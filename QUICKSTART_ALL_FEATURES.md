## Common Questions & Troubleshooting

### "Why is my portfolio total different from expected?"

**Possible causes:**
1. ✅ Mock data loaded (check if API keys configured in .env.local)
2. ✅ Positions from database haven't synced (wait 5 seconds for refresh)
3. ✅ Cash balance not included (check Portfolio tab → Balances & Cashflow)

**Solution:**
- Check .env.local has valid API keys
- Wait for Socket.IO connection (green indicator in header)
- Check browser console (F12 → Console tab) for errors
- Restart dashboard if no updates in 10 seconds

---

### "Chat interface isn't responding"

**Possible causes:**
1. ✅ ANTHROPIC_API_KEY not configured in .env.local
2. ✅ API key invalid or rate-limited (100 requests/minute limit)
3. ✅ Network connectivity issue
4. ✅ Backend server not running (express.js on port 3001)

**Solution:**
```bash
# 1. Verify .env.local has valid key
cat .env.local | grep ANTHROPIC_API_KEY

# 2. Check backend running
curl http://localhost:3001/api/dashboard

# 3. Check logs in Terminal 2 for errors
# Look for: "Error initializing Claude" or similar

# 4. Restart both servers
# Terminal 1: Ctrl+C then: npm run dev
# Terminal 2: Ctrl+C then: npm run server
```

---

### "Market data showing as 'N/A' or zero values"

**Possible causes:**
1. ✅ Market data API keys not configured (ALPHA_VANTAGE_API_KEY, POLYGON_API_KEY)
2. ✅ API rate limit exceeded (Free tier: 100-500 calls/day)
3. ✅ Stock ticker symbol typo in database
4. ✅ Market closed (weekends/holidays)

**Solution:**
```bash
# 1. Add market data API key to .env.local
ALPHA_VANTAGE_API_KEY=your_key_here

# 2. Restart dashboard (serverses need to reload .env)
# Ctrl+C on both terminals

# Terminal 1: npm run dev
# Terminal 2: npm run server

# 3. Check if mock data fallback working
# Open Global Markets tab → should see "Mock Data" indicator if real data unavailable
```

---

### "Chart visualizations not rendering / showing blank"

**Possible causes:**
1. ✅ Chart.js library not loaded (npm dependencies missing)
2. ✅ No data available for chart (empty positions array)
3. ✅ Browser JavaScript error (check console)
4. ✅ Component error caught by ErrorBoundary

**Solution:**
```bash
# 1. Verify dependencies installed
npm list chart.js react-chartjs-2

# 2. If missing, reinstall
npm install chart.js@4.5.1 react-chartjs-2@5.3.1

# 3. Check browser console for errors
# F12 → Console tab → look for red error messages

# 4. Check that portfolio has positions
# Overview tab → Portfolio Panel should show holdings
# If empty, that's why charts are blank
```

---

### "Socket.IO connection unstable / keeps reconnecting"

**Possible causes:**
1. ✅ Network connectivity intermittent
2. ✅ Backend server overloaded (too many requests)
3. ✅ Firewall blocking port 12345
4. ✅ CORS misconfiguration

**Solution:**
```bash
# 1. Check backend logs for connection errors
# Terminal 2 should show: "✓ Socket.IO listening on port 12345"
# If not: backend crashed

# 2. Verify port availability
# Windows: netstat -ano | findstr :12345
# Should see a process listening

# 3. Check update interval (too frequent = server overload)
# In .env.local: UPDATE_INTERVAL=5000 (5 seconds minimum)

# 4. Try with fallback to polling (if WebSocket unavailable)
# Dashboard should auto-detect and switch to HTTP polling
```

---

### "Dashboard slow / takes 10+ seconds to load"

**Possible causes:**
1. ✅ First load (Node modules compiling)
2. ✅ API calls slow (external market data APIs)
3. ✅ Database queries slow (large trade history)
4. ✅ Too many real-time updates (UPDATE_INTERVAL too low)

**Solution:**
```bash
# 1. Check if first load (this is normal)
# Subsequent loads should be <3 seconds

# 2. Increase UPDATE_INTERVAL in .env.local
UPDATE_INTERVAL=10000  # 10 seconds instead of 5

# 3. Check database size
# If >100K trades: might slow down. Consider archiving old trades.

# 4. Disable mock data generation if not needed
ENABLE_MOCK_DATA=false

# 5. Check API response times
# Terminal 2 logs should show: "API latency: 500ms" etc
# If >2 seconds: API key rate limited or no connectivity
```

---

### "Constitutional score showing same value for all positions"

**Possible causes:**
1. ✅ Constitutional scorer returning mock data
2. ✅ Not enough trade history to analyze (need >5 trades per position)
3. ✅ ConstitutionalScorer component not initialized

**Solution:**
- Make a few more trades to build history
- Check that your trades have dates and prices
- Constitutional scoring improves with more data (7+ trades per symbol)
- Refresh page (F5) to recalculate scores

---

## Advanced Features (Beyond Basics)

### Constitutional Scoring Explained (5 Yama Principles)

Your portfolio is scored on 5 ethical principles (the Yamas):

| Principle | Meaning | Example |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| **Satya** | Truthfulness | Avoiding misleading/manipulative trades |
| **Ahimsa** | Non-harm | Not investing in harmful industries |
| **Asteya** | Non-stealing | Fair pricing, no fraud |
| **Brahmacharya** | Moderation | Avoiding excess leverage/risk |
| **Aparigraha** | Non-attachment | Balanced portfolio (not overexposed) |

**Your Score = Average of all 5 principles** (displayed as 0.0 to 1.0)

Position gets HIGH score if:
- ✅ Company has transparent practices (Satya)
- ✅ Company doesn't harm communities (Ahimsa)
- ✅ Pricing fair/not manipulated (Asteya)
- ✅ Position size reasonable (Brahmacharya)
- ✅ Portfolio well-diversified (Aparigraha)

Position gets LOW score if:
- ❌ Company engages in fraud
- ❌ Invests in exploitative practices
- ❌ Overly concentrated in single asset
- ❌ High leverage (too much debt)
- ❌ Excessive speculation

---

### Fractal Dimensions Explained

The dashboard analyzes your portfolio across 3 dimensional perspectives:

**7D (Human Dimension)**
- Your goals, emotions, intuition
- Risk tolerance, time horizon
- Personal values

**9D (AI Dimension)**
- Quantitative analysis, pattern matching
- ML model predictions
- Statistical optimization

**14D (Symbiotic Dimension)**
- Integration of human + AI
- Constitutional ethics + data science
- Emergent insights from both systems

When Claude says "14D analysis," it means integrating all three perspectives!

---

### Panachy Cycles Explained

**Panachy** = study of cycles at different scales (from ancient Greek "pan" = all, "arkhía" = dominion)

The Panachy Cycles Graph shows:
- **Market Phases:** Bull, Bear, Sideways (detected automatically)
- **Cycle Duration:** How long each phase lasts
- **Fractal Scaling:** Same patterns repeat at different timescales
- **Next Phase:** Predicted transition point based on historical patterns

**Why it matters:** If you understand what phase the market is in, you can adjust your strategy accordingly!
